# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in C++ programming language.

## Overview

- **Data Structures:** Implementation of common data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, graph, tree etc.
- **Algorithms:** Implementation of fundamental algorithms such as sorting and searching.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SobujRoySunday/dsa.git
   ```

2. Explore the folders:

   - `01-maths`: Fundamental maths problems to build the logic.

3. Use the implementations:
   - Open the desired folder.
   - Review the code.
   - Understand the code.
   - Try to the code by yourself.
